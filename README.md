# Valentine's Day App 💖

This is a romantic Angular application designed to propose to your Valentine.

## Structure

- **Landing Page**: An animated envelope that invites the user to open it.
- **Proposal Page**: A cute "Will you be my Valentine?" question with a "Yes" button (celebration) and a "No" button (evasive).

## How to Run

Since the project files were created manually, you need to install dependencies first.

1.  Open a terminal in this directory:
    ```bash
    cd valentine-app
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4.  Navigate to `http://localhost:4200` in your browser.

## Features

- **Animations**: CSS animations for the heart beat and envelope opening.
- **Interactive**: The "No" button runs away from the cursor.
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile and desktop.
